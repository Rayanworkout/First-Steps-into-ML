# Basics of Machine Learning

This repository contains basics example of machine learning algorithms. The examples are implemented in Python3 using libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.

I personally use it as a reference to understand the algorithms and their implementation. I hope it will be helpful for you too.
